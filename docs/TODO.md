## 🎯 Feature asks — the first list (owner, 2026-08-26, verbatim then expanded)

Owner's words: *"Go live message for #live-now channel / Twitch activity
tracking on anyone in the discord (want an opt out, might need to scan for
people that dont have activity but tbd) / Youtube maybe / Event form
submission (someone fills out the information and the event is made in
discord) / Let form submission go to a mod review channel, make sure form uses
hammer time or normalizes timezone by user / Have bot ping when an event is
live / Birthday announcements / Opt in, cutover time / Moderation / Copy for
most moderation settings from other bots, exceptions list to be fined tuned
(pinging multiple people, role based exceptions) / Temporary voice channel —
https://tempvoice.xyz — Steal this / https://www.honeypotbot.com — Steal this /
Personality for the bot can be @d"*

Status: **BUILDING IN PARALLEL (owner, 2026-08-26 20:38: "do what you can to start working in parallel").** **EVERYTHING BUILT SO FAR IS LIVE — `8036918`, 2026-08-27 20:15 Phoenix, 2158 tests, 35 slash commands, schema 16, 17 dashboard pages / 89 routes** (all six figures re-measured 2026-08-31; this line previously read `256f43d` / 07:46 / 1195 tests / 30 commands / schema 11 / 13 tabs)**:** the seven core phases (shadow/test mode), the full dashboard, `/voice` + panel + per-user memory, `/help`, bot About Me + "Cookout attendees: N" status, parity/Carl removed, Health tab lists all 7 loops, plus Phase 9 role approvals, **Phase 10 polls, Phase 11 chat 2, Phase 12 logs and Phase 13 requests**. Owner's test sweep in progress; feedback → batches. `deploys.log` has every deploy (**37** to date, counted 2026-08-31). Phases 5, 6, 7 building in git worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` (gitignored) on their own branches, schema versions pre-assigned 6/7/8, shared files touched append-only. **Merge order: Phase 4 fixes → deploy → merge 5 → review/fix → merge 6 → review/fix → merge 7 → review/fix; re-key `code-notes.md` after each merge; deploy from `main` only.** If a session inherits this mid-flight: `git worktree list` shows the branches; never deploy with a dirty main tree. Build order
approved (Q13): see `info/feature-list.md`. Design docs: `info/phase1-design.md`
(settings, action log, role menus), `info/phase2-design.md` (go-live feed);
later phases get theirs before dispatch.

**Autonomy (owner, 2026-08-26 18:15): "keep going and only stop building the
phases if im needed for a critical choice. I can do a big test sweep when i get
back."** So: each phase = design → Opus build → Fable review → deploy in
TEST_MODE/shadow → next phase; owner does one consolidated test sweep later.
Every phase landing gets a `DONE.md` entry and a "what to click" row in
[`access/sweeps.md`](access/sweeps.md).

**F12 website placement (owner asked 2026-08-26): Phase 8, immediately after
the seven core phases.** Phase 1's settings store + audit log and the existing
FastAPI module are built as its foundation.

**Rollout rule (owner, 2026-08-26):** Black Bloc eventually replaces ALL of
Birthday Bot, Carl-bot, Modmail and YAGPDB — "rome wasn't built in a day".
Every feature that acts on members ships **shadow/log → watch → on**, flipped
per feature, so the old bot keeps running until the new one is proven.

| # | Feature | Open questions (answers land here) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | **Go-live → `#live-now`** | **DECIDED 2026-08-26: BOTH** — presence for discovery of anyone, Twitch EventSub (websocket) for rich posts on linked accounts; opt-out covers both. **PRIMARY = Discord presence/activity; Twitch EventSub is the FALLBACK/enrichment** (owner, 2026-08-26). **Measured incumbent (rescan):** YAGPDB posts ~8/day, 30 distinct streamers, template `REGULATORS! Mount up! **{login}** is currently streaming **{game}**! Check it out: https://www.twitch.tv/{login}` — keep the prefix; 4/199 posts render game as `****` (no category) → need a fallback; Twitch login ≠ Discord name (`thepresidentnoir`→`twitch.tv/prez`) → `/twitch link` is mandatory; YAG re-posts on restart/category change → **debounce**. Rich card = Discord's own link preview (free). Channel topic is stale ("post your links here") — fix when F1 ships. | design |
| F2 | **Twitch activity tracking** — **DECIDED 2026-08-26: YAGPDB "Streaming"-style.** Presence-based; when a member goes live post "X is live" (+title/link) to the channel; optional *Live* role while streaming; require-role / ignore-role filters; opt-out. No stats/leaderboard. Merges with F1 (one design doc). "Scan for inactive" still TBD. | design |
| F3 | **YouTube** — *maybe* | Go-live only, or uploads too. Parked until F1 lands. | parked |
| F4 | **Event form → Discord Scheduled Event**, via review | **DECIDED 2026-08-26 (all blanks filled):** `/event create` **modal**. **Timezone:** Discord exposes no user timezone to bots (only language locale) → entered once via `/timezone set` with city autocomplete, default = server zone (America/Phoenix). **Review = a channel per submission** (like Modmail today) under an **Events** category, named `<status>-<user>-<event>` e.g. `pending-sky-block-party` → renamed `approved-…` / `denied-…` (Discord channel names are lowercase a-z0-9-_ only, so `!` and spaces are normalised). **Approvers = anyone who can see `#mute-me-bot-test-spam`** — i.e. Aunties/Uncles, Leads, Committee, etc.; implement as "roles with View on the configured staff channel/category", not a hard-coded list. **Create a real Discord Scheduled Event: toggle, default ON.** | design |
| F5 | **Ping when an event goes live** | **DECIDED 2026-08-26:** announce in **`#live-now`** (channel set in an options menu); **role ping is a setting**, default *none* (YAG pings nobody today). See F14 for the roles. | design |
| F14 | **Ping roles** (owner, 2026-08-26): an opt-in **Events** role for go-live/event pings, and **favourite-streamer roles** — per-streamer opt-in pings ("people that want to see SuperNamu only … can get her pings"). Wire into F1/F5 announcements and the role menus. | future |
| F6 | **Birthday announcements**, opt-in, with a "cutover time" | **Seed data:** Birthday Bot export (39 rows) at `archive/current-bots/birthday-bot-export-2026-08-05.md`. **Measured incumbent (rescan, 16 posts):** channel **`#return-of-the-gen`** (`1411816390414962700`), an embed `Happy Birthday **{display_name}**!` colour `#4eefff`, no ping, no role; fires at **≈00:03 local midnight in a PER-MEMBER timezone** (UTC-4 ×8, -5 ×4, -6 ×2, -7 ×1, +1 ×1) — contradicts the bot's own "server time zone" blurb. 🔴 **Phoenix gotcha: 15 of 16 landed the evening BEFORE the birthday in Phoenix terms.** **DECIDED 2026-08-26 (Q12): per-member midnight** (uses the F4 `/timezone` store); **fallback = server midnight (America/Phoenix)** when a member has no timezone set. The `🎂` role's grantor is unknown (Birthday Bot lacks manage_roles). | design |
| F7 | **Moderation** — copy the *usual* settings from other bots; exceptions list fine-tuned later (mass pings, role-based exceptions) | **Carl's live config captured** (`archive/current-bots/carl-bot-dashboard-2026-08-26.md`): only mention-spam (5/30s → delete+warn+5-min timeout) is armed; whitelists empty; warn threshold 8 with no punishment. **YAGPDB automod measured OFF.** `#carlbot-logs`: 7 warn cases in ~2 years — quiet server, do not over-tune. **DECIDED 2026-08-26 (Q11): "follow what exists"** — reproduce Carl's live config as-is (mention-spam 5/30s → delete+warn+5-min timeout; everything else log-only), warn/timeout/kick/ban commands, modlog, exempt roles = staff set; **tune in shadow mode**, change later. | design |
| F8 | **Temporary voice channels** — replicate tempvoice.xyz | **DECIDED 2026-08-26:** one creator voice channel named **"join to create a channel"** in the existing voice-channel area, positioned **directly above "You Still Here?"** (the AFK channel — keep it above, never below); spawned channels named **`{user}'s bloc`**, placed next to the creator, deleted when empty; owner control panel (rename / limit / lock / hide / kick / ban / claim / transfer) per `info/reference-bots.md`; usable by **`Member`** to start. | design |
| F9 | **Honeypot** — replicate honeypotbot.com | **DECIDED 2026-08-26:** honeypot channel(s) at the bottom with a pinned "do not post here" notice; anything posted → **ban + purge messages**, shipped **shadow-first** (log would-ban for a week, act on nothing) then enforce. **Exempt:** all bots + anyone who can see the staff channel (same rule as F4 approvers). **Log channel:** `#mute-me-bot-test-spam` for now — the owner will **rename it to `#black-block-logs`** (spelling confirmed 2026-08-26) when the bot leaves test mode; the log channel is a setting, so the rename costs nothing. The scan found no existing honeypot channel; Carl's honeypot section is unconfigured. | design |
| F10 | **Conversation when @-mentioned** ("@'d", owner clarified 2026-08-26): when someone pings the bot it holds "some semblance of a conversation" — an LLM-backed reply. | **PARKED by owner until after core features.** Needs an LLM provider + key + a cost cap; personality/tone TBD then. | parked |
| F11 | **Modmail** (added by owner 2026-08-26 — replaces the Modmail bot) | **DECIDED 2026-08-26: do what the current bot does (channel-per-ticket in the ModMail category, topic `ModMail Channel <user-id> <channel-id>`), AND wire a second mode — private threads in one staff channel — as a setting** ("wire up the option to be in 2 channel"); the toggle is ported to the F12 website later. Reference: `info/reference-bots.md` (Modmail command table). | design |
| F13 | **Verification Bot** — **rescan result: dormant** (1 message in ~2 years, its own join notice); no use cases to port. Also found dormant: `baf#0659` (a Red-DiscordBot install, ~1 yr idle) and `Black Block#1423` — **two prior attempts at this project**. Recommend kicking all three once Black Bloc is stable (owner action; on the cleanup list). `Wordle` is a Discord built-in activity webhook (422-day streak) — leave it alone. | closed → cleanup |
| F17 | **Role-process takeover + audit** (owner, 2026-08-26: "grab all the roles and settings carl already has so we dont need to recreate them, same emojis too … audit each user and their roles so we can take over that process") | **Audit captured:** `archive/current-bots/role-audit-2026-08-26.md` — 118 humans, 7 bots, 59 roles, every member's roles, per-role counts, self-assign holders; **4 humans lack `Member`** (simonebwest, FFStreamWatcher, scrybaby, UraniumAnchor), 1 has no roles (scrybaby). Carl's panels/emojis already reproduced by `/rolemenu seed-defaults`; **fix:** Marathons must use Carl's custom emoji `<:JoyGAMING:1337948924844965931>` instead of 🎮 (do at Phase 2 review). **DECIDED 2026-08-26:** `Member` is granted by **Discord's own rules screen** (owner: "i think discord rules") — Black Bloc does not take over the gate; the 4 non-Members are for the owner to handle by hand. **YAG's 3 role-command groups become Bloc menus:** *Student/Teacher* folds into the existing `mentoring` panel (Mentor/Initiate); *Runner Status* (Runner / Live Runner / Commentator) becomes a **staff-assigned** set via a new `/rolemenu` mode `staff` (staff picks the member, not self-serve); *Rule Reader* is redundant with the Discord rules screen — dropped. "We can change later." → add to the next builder's scope (Phase 3 rider). | decided — build in Phase 3 |
| F12 | **Config website for mods/admins** — **DESIGNED 2026-08-26: `info/phase8-design.md`. Owner decisions 2026-08-26 18:30 (verbatim): "we can use blackbloc.heygabi.ai for now until the org decides on a name and then we port it to that domain … this site needs to be entirely disconnected from heygabi … discord login verification only except my google sso as the owner admin of the whole domain … we'll need to link my discord verification to my google sso in the future. only people/roles who can currently see the spam channel we're testing in should be able to get on the bot, aunties/uncles mainly and the roles above it."** Static site on Cloudflare Pages wearing the estate template (`estate-theme.css`, `theme.js` 5-theme dropdown, `permission-ux.js`, fonts from `catalog-platform/sites/heygabi-home`), Discord-OAuth login gated on the same staff-role rule as slash commands, FastAPI routers inside the bot process on Fly, 12 pages mapped from Carl/YAG dashboards onto F1–F16, one settings store + audit. **8a read-only status page can ship right after Phase 2; 8b full dashboard after Phase 7.** Owner decisions deferred to then: hostname, Discord-only vs +estate SSO, who may edit moderation rules. | designed — Phase 8 |

## 📋 Session 2026-08-31 (owner back from the trip)

- **Owner 2026-08-31 ~10:13: "read all docs and global rules, lets get started with whats left on our todo list"** → B4–B8 built and **LIVE `3cae955`, deployed 11:32 (see `DONE.md` entry + `deploys.log`)**; owner sweep rows 21–24. Next in the queue: restyle R1/R2 + the KI-6/KI-9 security build (below).
- **Owner 2026-08-31 ~10:16, verbatim: "also read all docs and verify if theyer stale or need updating too"** → full docs staleness audit vs measured repo/deploy state. Status: **LANDED — 26 files reviewed + committed `d87ee84`; the same morning's bookkeeping sweep then moved the 30 landed items to `DONE.md` and consolidated owner checks into `access/sweeps.md` (rows 18–20 + phase scripts). Follow-ups queued below: code-notes re-key, KI-6/KI-9, DB backup drill.**
- **Hook finding fixed 10:15:** `scripts/docs/` (a tooling folder holding `move_done.py`, not a docs tree) tripped the session-start docs-shape check every session → renamed to `scripts/doctools/`, runbook reference updated, committed + pushed `7b7840b`.
- **DECIDED 2026-08-31 ~10:25 (owner): `docs/` stays TRACKED permanently** ("actually lets keep it tracked", after first picking purge). The 2026-08-26 local-only rule is retired; secret NAMES only still applies. `docs/` removed from `.gitignore`; the LOCAL ONLY / TEMPORARILY TRACKED headers across docs and the CLAUDE.md line get updated in the docs-audit review pass (audit agent is mid-flight in those files).

## ⏳ Waiting on the owner

- **F-table open questions:** only F2's "scan for inactive streamers" is still TBD; everything else in the table is decided.
- **Test sweep — the whole list lives in [`access/sweeps.md`](access/sweeps.md)** (20 rows in priority order + the detailed phase 1–8a scripts, moved there whole 2026-08-31; it is the ONE home for what a person has not yet exercised).
- **Twitch developer app** — owner is creating it (2026-08-26); `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` /
  `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` go in `.env`. Fallback path only; F1 ships on presence first.
- **Cleanup (later, owner):** kick the dormant bots `Verification Bot`, `baf`,
  `Black Block` once Black Bloc is stable.

## 🔧 Open engineering items


- **F4 follow-ups (owner, 2026-08-26):** (a) add the requesting user to their
  own event channel so they can post updates / answer mod questions — or show
  them a ticket page on the F12 site; (b) the approver-roles / event-category /
  create-scheduled-event toggle all become F12 site settings.
- **F5 follow-ups (owner, 2026-08-26):** announce channel + ping role editable
  in the options menu now and on the F12 site later.
- **Go-live follow-ups from the review fixer (2026-08-26):** (a) `live_role_added`
  is a 0/1 flag — store the role *id* so a mid-stream change of
  `golive_live_role_id` cannot strand the old role; (b) session age-out only ticks
  when Twitch creds exist (the poller) — add a creds-independent tick; (c) a failed
  Helix live-check leaves a session open (age-out is the backstop). None block shadow.

- **Curated docs for peers** (owner, 2026-08-26: "give them the curated docs
  they need"). Since 2026-08-31 `docs/` is tracked, so a peer who clones gets the
  FULL working tree — the root `README.md` still describes only "an optional
  FastAPI companion server", not the 17-page dashboard. Open: whether the full
  docs tree IS the peer docs now, or `README.md` gets a proper curated rewrite.
  Ask the owner when the first peer needs it.

- **Move the SQLite file out of the OneDrive-synced tree** — KI-1.

- **Site restyle R1 + R2** (owner decisions 2026-08-31, all six taken; brief =
  [`info/site-restyle-design.md`](info/site-restyle-design.md)): R1 shell
  (top bar, grouped nav + icons, width-filling grid, docked dirty save bar,
  human labels) then R2 skin (the "Black Bloc" theme dark+light as default,
  wordmark, copy voice, table furniture, Ctrl+K palette, show-keys toggle).
  **Queued AFTER the B4–B8 builder merges** — both touch `site/`.
- **`code-notes.md` re-key** — measured 2026-08-31: 88 files / 22,333 insertions
  since the last re-key (`666dd8e`); 4 of 4 spot-checked `bot.py` keys miss.
  A build-sized diff-driven pass (the file carries a red warning meanwhile).
  Queue after B4–B8 merges (the builder appends entries to the same file).
- **KI-6 / KI-9 thresholds CROSSED by Phase 13** (found by the docs audit
  2026-08-31): the dashboard now admits any signed-in guild member, so KI-6's
  ">1 site user" trigger (sessions table + a per-session id in the cookie +
  revocation on logout) and KI-9's (HMAC poll-vote hashing with a
  `POLL_VOTE_SECRET`) are due. Small security build; queue after B4–B8.
- **DB backup drill** (RECOVERY gap re-opened by the docs audit 2026-08-31):
  the live volume now holds real rows (38 birthdays + settings + cases) and
  RECOVERY.md's own threshold — "the first table with real data" — has passed.
  Need: a dump path off the Fly volume (`flyctl ssh sftp` or a scheduled
  export), drilled once, documented in `access/RECOVERY.md`.

- **Owner 2026-08-27 ~11:49, verbatim: "Probably should make a deploy button api so you can deploy for me if you can't permission"** → idea logged. Today: the owner's standing authorisation works — the last four deploys ran from the session. A deploy endpoint on the bot would need a Fly API token on the machine and a self-redeploy path; higher risk than value while the session can deploy. Status: **parked unless the classifier blocks again.**
